Currently, I am a Lead Researcher at the Technology Innovation Institute, where I focus on network security and secure communication protocols. My role involves developing innovative proposals and converting them into commercial products, patents, and research publications. I am a Senior Member of IEEE, with 19 research papers published in top IEEE journals and conferences. I have also filed over 15 US patent applications and hold more than 10 granted US patents.

In my previous role as an Architect at Samsung R&D Institute in Bangalore, I conducted research on the TCP/IP protocol suite, contributing to the development of next-generation transport layer technologies. Prior to Samsung, I served as a Senior Associate at Novell Software Development India Private Ltd, where I played a significant role in the design and development of DNS and DHCP components for the Open Enterprise Server (OES). I have also worked as a developer at Huawei and Protechsoft Technologies, contributing to various network applications, including web server, messaging, and email server development.
