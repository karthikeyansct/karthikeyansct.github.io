This paper introduces a Context-oriented Transport (CoT) layer designed to enhance QoS in next-generation networks by understanding application context and adapting to dynamic conditions. CoT improves network capacity utilization and prioritizes traffic flows, achieving significant gains in latency and throughput, as demonstrated in prototype evaluations.
