To improve the performance of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) was introduced. However, from the recent literature, in the wireless networks, QUIC does not fully utilize the link capacity, because of varying network wireless medium characteristics for an application. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, this paper has proposed two novel protocols to overcome the wireless network’s challenges, by MultiPipe (multi sessions) QUIC protocol (MP-QUIC). The two MP-QUIC’s novel protocols are (i) Round Robin MP-QUIC (RR-MP-QUIC) and (ii) Cross-Layer Burst Aware MP-QUIC (CBA-MP-QUIC). In RR-MP-QUIC, multiple pipes are created between source as well as destination and assign a pipe to each object in a round-robin manner. We set up the testbed over live air commercial network. The experimental results reveal that the RR-MP-QUIC Page Load Time (PLT) of a web page decreases by 76% with respect to QUIC. Furthermore, to improve the performance of RR-MPQUIC, we proposed CBA-MP-QUIC, which optimally creates pipes, efficiently schedules the objects and understands with respect to cross-layer (wireless channel characteristics and load in data link layer) parameters. Hence this adapts dynamically to the network conditions and maintains fairness between the applications in User Equipment (UE) and within the same application. Experimental result of CBA-MP-QUIC on live air improves the web page PLT by 143% with respect to QUIC.
