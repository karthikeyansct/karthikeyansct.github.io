At present, most of the research work going around focuses on evolution of Next Generation Networks (NGN). The primary focus of this research work is towards improving the performance by reducing latency in network, increasing peak throughput and improving spectral efficiencies. Even though Fifth Generation (5G) network standards set its requirement to lower the latency, the Internet Protocol (IP) suite introduces significant delay in the network. For example, Domain Name System (DNS) resolution in a device takes at least one Round Trip Time (RTT) irrespective of the network infrastructure. Sometimes, slow responsiveness of DNS server triggers client to send multiple queries, which results in user perceived delay in the client application. Moreover, DNS resolution delays socket set-up time and creates connectivity overhead to the client application and also affects user experience significantly. We considered this limitation and propose a novel solution called Flare-DNS Resolver (FDR). It is a lightweight and client only solution which can be easily deployed across all mobile platforms. We successfully implemented FDR in Samsung flagship models having Android Oreo Operating System. The recent version of FDR is tested in both Samsung Galaxy S8 and S9 variants. FDR significantly improves application page loading time by 10% to 15% consistently.
