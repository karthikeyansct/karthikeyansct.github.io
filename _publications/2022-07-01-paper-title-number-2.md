collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-07-01-paper-title-number-2
exerpt: 'The paper proposes a Link Quality-assisted Transport (LQaT) solution to address the challenges of frequent channel quality fluctuations in high-frequency bands like mmWave and TeraHertz, common in 5G and beyond. By leveraging real-time link quality estimation, LQaT enhances congestion and flow control, improving throughput by up to 34% and reducing latency by up to 28%, as demonstrated in ns-3 simulations'
