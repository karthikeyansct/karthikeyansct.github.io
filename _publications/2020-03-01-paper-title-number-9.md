excerpt: 'This conference paper talks about NexGen Connectivity Optimizer (NexGenCO), a solution designed to address connectivity overheads in dual-stack networks by utilizing network-aware concurrency and intelligent DNS caching. NexGenCO enhances application performance by reducing DNS lookup and TCP connection times, improving page loading efficiency, as validated on real-world devices.'

The Next Generation Networks (NGN) set its standard to provide very high data rates, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), increased network capacity and significantly improved Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, it provides an infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT) to power billions of connected devices. With this upsurge in IoT devices, the need for adopting IPv6 over exhausting IPv4 addresses becomes more unavoidable. Hence, Internet Service Providers (ISP's) are adopting IPv6 along with IPv4 addresses using an address transition method called dual-stack. However, the Dual-Stack network causes relatively more connectivity overhead than the single stack network. For example, DNS lookup and TCP connection time are comparatively high in dual-stack mobile devices. This affects the page loading time of the application, thereby impacting the user experience significantly. In this paper, we analyzed all these connectivity overheads and propose a novel solution called NexGen Connectivity optimizer (NexGenCO), which provides better connectivity for the applications using network-aware concurrency and intelligent DNS caching. NexGenCO is prototyped and evaluated in Samsung devices with Android Pie. It significantly reduces connectivity overhead and improves page loading time up to 18% consistently.
