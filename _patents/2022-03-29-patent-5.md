**Patent Number (Granted): US20200236139A1**

The embodiments herein disclose methods and systems for reducing network protocol latency for at least one application on an electronic device, a method includes pre-resolving a plurality of Domain Name System (DNS) queries for the at least one application. The plurality of DNS queries is pre-resolved before triggering at least one DNS resolution query from the at least one application. The method includes pre-connecting a plurality of TCP connections of the at least one application with at least one Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) server. The plurality of TCP connections are pre-connected before triggering at least one TCP connection request from the at least one application. The method includes exchanging a plurality of secure certificates with the at least one TCP server to secure the plurality of pre-connected TCP connections. The secure certificates are exchanged before receiving at least one request from the at least one application for secure certificate negotiation.
