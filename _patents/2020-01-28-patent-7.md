**Patent Number (Granted): US20190222520A1**

Connection based selection of a network congestion control process is presented herein. A system can comprise a processor; and a memory that stores executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, facilitate performance of operations, comprising: storing communication congestion control procedures into a module of a kernel of the system, determining a connection attribute for a connection corresponding to a connection request received from a device; and selecting, via the module based on the connection attribute, a communication congestion control procedure of the communication congestion control procedures for servicing of the connection request. In an example, the determining the connection attribute comprises determining a round-trip time of the connection, determining a bandwidth-delay product of the connection, determining whether the connection is a wireless connection, and determining a bandwidth of the connection.
