**Patent Number (Granted): US11317456B2**

A method and apparatus are provided for handling a data path creation in a quick user datagram protocol (UDP) Internet connection (QUIC) session in a wireless network system. The method includes receiving, by an electronic device, at least one request from at least one application for processing at least one object, determining at least one network condition based on the plurality of parameters associated with the electronic device, determining whether the at least one network condition meets a network criteria, and creating a number of data paths within the QUIC session based on the determination.
