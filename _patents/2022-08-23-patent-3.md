**Patent Number (Granted): US11425565B2**

A method for Multipath Quick User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Internet Connections (MPQUIC) over Quick SOCKS (QSOCKS) in a wireless network is provided. The method includes receiving, by a QSOCKS server, a Client Hello (CHLO) message from a QSOCKS client device using a QSOCKS method tag, wherein the CHLO message comprises a plurality of client-supported SOCKS Authentication (AUTH) procedures, selecting, by the QSOCKS server, a candidate client-supported SOCKS AUTH procedure from the plurality of client-supported SOCKS AUTH procedures, and transmitting, by the QSOCKS server, a reject packet using the QSKM tag to the QSOCKS client device, wherein the reject packet includes information indicating the selected candidate client-supported SOCKS AUTH procedure.
