**Abstract**

Embodiments herein include a method for concurrently performing asynchronous operations over IPv4 and IPv6 in a mobile device. The method includes capturing a DNS query-pattern of a plurality of DNS queries for a plurality of services of an application in the mobile device. Further, the method includes performing a DNS lookup in a DNS cache, to obtain a DNS resolution over the IPv4 and the IPv6 based on the DNS query-pattern of the plurality of DNS queries for the plurality of services of the application. Further, the method includes storing the DNS resolution based on the DNS lookup in the DNS cache. Further, the method includes triggering a TCP connection using a pre-connected connection descriptor based on a domain name resolution. Further, the method includes storing the pre-connected connection descriptor corresponding to the TCP connection in a connection pool cache.
