excerpt: 'This patent describes a method for scheduling network packets based on CLAT Aware Affinity (CAA) using a multi-core processor in a user equipment (UE). It involves the CAA scheduler analyzing the packets path characteristics, determining the appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 connection, and scheduling the packet to the relevant server, while classifying and distributing the packet across the processor cores for efficient handling.'

**Patent Number (Granted): US11606418B2**

Embodiments herein provide a method for CLAT Aware Affinity (CAA)-based scheduling by a user equipment (UE) comprising a multi-core processor. The method includes a CAA scheduler at the user equipment  receiving a packet and determining a path characteristic of the packet. Further, the method includes the CAA scheduler determining, at least one of a IPv4 connection and a IPv6 connection based the path characteristic of the packet; and establishing a connection to at least one of an IPv4 server and an IPv6 server based on the determined at least one of the IPv4 connection and the IPv6 connection. Further, the method includes the CAA scheduler  classifying the packet into at least one class and scheduling the packet on at least one core of the multi-core processor based on the at least one class.
