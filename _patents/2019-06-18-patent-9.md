**Patent Number (Granted): US10327206B2**

Embodiments herein provide a TCP optimizer (TO) and method for controlling TCP packets due to closure of a TCP connection for power saving. The method includes monitoring TCP closures, for controlling the TCP packets. The TO can be configured to determine a pattern of TCP packets based on a plurality of parameters associated with a TCP connection. Further, the TO can be configured to detect that the pattern corresponds to a TCP closure retransmission or TCP zero window closure category based on a historic pattern of TCP packets. Further, the TO can be configured to terminate the TCP connection. The proposed method allows controlling TCP packets to save power in a mobile device thus improving the life time of a battery of the mobile device.
