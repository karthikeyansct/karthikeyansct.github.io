**Patent Number (Granted): US11962656B2**

A method of discovering edge-servers and services through domain name server (DNS) resolution in a mobile edge computing (MEC) platform based network is provided. The method includes communicating a DNS-query from a user-equipment to a DNS server, wherein DNS query pertains to a user-request for accessing one or more web-based services. The user equipment (UE) receives, from the DNS server, a response comprising details with respect to a plurality of available-servers configured for rendering the web-based services. The details comprises at-least one of, an indication of the server being edge server associated with the MEC platform or a remote-server, a location of the server, and one or more services associated with the server. Each of the available servers are evaluated by the UE based on the response at-least based on the plurality of associated services and a distance of the server with respect to the UE.
